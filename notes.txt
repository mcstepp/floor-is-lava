### Forum

1. Threads

### Tinker/seeder commands
A. Refresh if needed
    1. php artisan migrate:refresh
B. Tinker
    1. php artisan tinker
    2. $threads = factory('App\Thread', 50)->create();
    3. $threads->each(function($thread){
        factory('App\Reply', 10)->create(['thread_id' => $thread->id]);
    });

### Testing

A. General
    1. Use separate testing database, not the local/prod database.
    2. Configure testing env in .env and phpunit.xml
    3. config/database.php exposes DB_DATABASE
    4. Use :memory: -> not using an actual file, just do it memory. it's just a test
    5. Use DatabaseMigrations trait -> for every test, migrate everything that needs to be migrated.
       If anything changes, roll it back before the test completes. UNDO IT ALL.
    6. start test names with "test_" or add a doc block before the test
B.  Testing commands
    1. phpunit

C. Test Setup
    1. Extends setup method -> `setUp()`
    2. Call parent setup first
    3. Reusable
        a. Assign thread to `this`
D. Feature Tests
    1. High-level, browser side user tests

E. Unit tests
    1. Inside-out tests, granular

### Artisan / composer song and dance
A. php artisan cache:clear -> clears caches, unfucks some stucks.
B. composer dump-autoload -o -> main culprit esp. when working with vagrant and things not updating
C. Honorable Mentions
    1. composer update
    2. php artisan migrate:rollback

### Show Threads
A. Links
    1. path method right on the model -> `$thread->path()`
        a. Thread knows about the url?
        b. No, it just knows a string presentation of the thread
    2. Typical way -> build up using id, title, slug, whatever floats your boat

B. Replies
    1. Since using `owner`, need to use foreign key so it matches to something in the database for the relationship
